# Project Knowledge Graph

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** Not yet populated
**Purpose:** Persistent knowledge base that accumulates across research sessions

---

## 📋 Overview

This knowledge graph captures and retains project understanding across multiple research sessions. It is automatically updated by the `/prompt-research` command and serves as long-term memory for the multi-agent research system.

**Update Strategy:**
- Append new knowledge after each research session
- Merge non-conflicting information
- Flag conflicts for manual resolution
- Auto-summarize when file grows large (>10 MB)

- New findings are appended to existing sections
- Conflicting information is flagged with [CONFLICT] marker
- User resolves conflicts manually
- Auto-summarization triggers at 10 MB file size

**Cross-Session Retention:**
- All knowledge persists indefinitely (90-day default, configurable)
- Git-tracked for version history
- Backed up with project files

**Integration Points:**
- Lead Agent reads this file before research planning
- Result Aggregator updates this file after research completion
- Citation Index cross-references findings
- Architectural Context supplements with deeper analysis
- Learning System uses this to improve smart defaults

---

**This knowledge graph will grow with each research session, building comprehensive project understanding over time.**
