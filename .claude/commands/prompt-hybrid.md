## Phase 0: Prompt Perfection with Hybrid Intelligence

**Import:** Use Phase 0 from `.claude/library/prompt-perfection-core.md`

**Adaptation:** Technical with Hybrid Intelligence (from `.claude/library/adapters/technical-adapter.md`)

**Enhanced Flow:**

The canonical Phase 0 flow is enhanced with hybrid intelligence at specific steps:

### Enhanced Step 0.1: Initial Analysis + Complexity Detection

**Standard Phase 0 Step 0.1:**
- Detect language (Slovak / English)
- Identify prompt type
- Extract core intent

**THEN add Complexity Detection:**

Read configuration from: `.claude/config/complexity-rules.json`

**Analyze prompt for complexity signals:**

**Complexity Triggers (with weights):**
- Multi-file scope (5): "multiple files", "across files", "in all", "entire codebase"
- Architecture questions (7): "how does", "where is", "what handles", "explain the"
- Pattern detection (6): "existing pattern", "current convention", "like other", "similar to"
- Feasibility check (4): "is it possible", "can we", "will this work", "compatible with"
- Implementation planning (3): "implement", "build", "create feature", "add functionality"
- Cross-cutting concerns (4): "authentication", "logging", "error handling", "caching"
- Refactoring tasks (5): "refactor", "restructure", "reorganize", "clean up"

**Calculate complexity score:**
- Sum the weight of all matched triggers
- Thresholds:
  - 0-4: **Simple** (inline validation)
  - 5-9: **Moderate** (ask user)
  - 10+: **Complex** (spawn agent)
  - 15+: **Very High** (multi-agent verification)

**Output complexity analysis:**
```markdown
**Phase 0: Prompt Perfection**

**Detected Language:** [Slovak / English]
**Prompt Type:** [type]
**Core Intent:** [intent]

**Complexity Analysis:**
Matched Triggers:
- [trigger 1] (weight: X)
- [trigger 2] (weight: Y)

Complexity Score: [total]
Category: [Simple / Moderate / Complex / Very High]
```

**Decision Point:**
- IF score < 5 → Continue with standard Phase 0 (Simple Path)
- IF score 5-9 → Ask user: "This prompt has moderate complexity. Would you like me to use an agent to analyze the codebase for better context? (yes/no)"
  - If yes → Go to Enhanced Step 0.2 (Complex Path)
  - If no → Continue with standard Phase 0 (Simple Path)
- IF score >= 10 → Go to Enhanced Step 0.2 (Complex Path)
- IF score >= 15 → Go to Enhanced Step 0.2 + Multi-Agent Verification

### Complex Path: Agent-Enhanced Phase 0 Flow

**When complexity score >= 10:**

### Enhanced Step 0.2: Agent Context Gathering

**Before running standard Step 0.2 Completeness Check, gather codebase context:**

#### Step 0.2.1: Check Agent Result Cache ⚡ **NEW**

Read cache configuration from: `.claude/config/cache-config.json`

**IF caching is enabled:**

1. **Generate cache key** from:
   - User prompt (normalized)
   - Current git branch
   - File hashes of relevant extensions (.cs, .js, .tsx, .json, etc.)
   - Agent template to be used

2. **Check cache directory:** `.claude/cache/agent-results/`

3. **Validate cached result:**
   - Check timestamp (max age: 24 hours default)
   - Verify files haven't changed (compare hashes)
   - Confirm same git branch
   - Ensure same agent template

**IF valid cache found:**
```markdown
⚡ **Cache Hit - Using Previous Analysis**

Cached from: [timestamp] ([X] hours ago)
Agent type: [Explore / Plan]
Files analyzed: [count]
Branch: [branch name]

Loading cached results... ✅
```

**Use cached agent results** and **skip to Step 0.2.3** (Process Agent Results)

**IF no cache or invalid:**
```markdown
💾 **No valid cache found - Running fresh analysis**

Reason: [Cache miss / Expired / Files changed / Branch changed]
```

**Continue to Step 0.2.2** (Spawn Agent)

---

#### Step 0.2.2: Spawn Exploration Agent

Read agent template configuration from: `.claude/config/agent-templates.json`

**Determine agent type based on complexity triggers:**
- Architecture questions, multi-file scope, cross-cutting → **Explore agent** with "explore_codebase_context" template
- Pattern detection needed → **Explore agent** with "detect_patterns_and_conventions" template
- Feasibility check → **Explore agent** with "validate_technical_feasibility" template
- Implementation planning, refactoring → **Plan agent** with "plan_implementation" template

**Inform user:**
```markdown
🤖 **Spawning agent for codebase analysis...**

Complexity score: [score]
Agent type: [Explore / Plan]
Task: [brief description]

This will take 10-30 seconds. Analyzing codebase to gather context...
```

**Build agent prompt** from template, replacing:
- `{user_prompt}` with original user input
- `{keywords}` with extracted keywords
- `{scope}` with detected scope
- `{context}` with available context

**Use the Task tool to spawn the agent:**
```
Task(
  subagent_type="Explore" or "Plan",
  description="Gather codebase context for prompt",
  prompt=[built agent prompt from template],
  model="haiku" for Explore, "sonnet" for Plan
)
```

**Wait for agent to complete.**

---

#### Step 0.2.3: Process Agent Results

**Agent returns structured context. Display summary:**

```markdown
✅ **Agent Analysis Complete**

### Key Findings:
- Relevant Files: [list from agent]
- Patterns Detected: [patterns from agent]
- Technical Feasibility: [feasibility from agent]
- Blockers: [blockers from agent or "None"]

### Agent Recommendations:

Spawning [2-3] additional agents with different strategies...

**Verification Strategies:**
1. **Breadth-First Exploration** (Haiku, 30s) - Wide coverage
2. **Depth-First Analysis** (Sonnet, 45s) - Detailed investigation
3. **Pattern-Focused Verification** (Haiku, 30s) - Convention validation

Running agents in parallel... ⏳
```

**Spawn multiple agents concurrently** using different strategies (configured in verification-config.json).

**Wait for all agents to complete.**

**Analyze consensus:**

```markdown
✅ **Multi-Agent Verification Complete**

## Advanced Features Guide ⚡🔍📚 **NEW**

### Agent Result Caching ⚡

**How it works:**
- Agent analysis results are cached for 24 hours (configurable)
- Cache key includes: prompt + file hashes + git branch + agent template
- Cache invalidates when: files change, branch changes, time expires

**Benefits:**
- 10-20x faster for repeated/similar prompts
- Saves agent costs (no re-analysis)
- Consistent results for same context

**Cache hit example:**
```
⚡ Cache Hit - Using Previous Analysis
Cached from: 2024-12-18 14:30 (2 hours ago)
Agent type: Explore
Files analyzed: 23
Branch: main
Loading cached results... ✅
```

**To clear cache:**
- Delete `.claude/cache/agent-results/` directory
- Or wait for 24h auto-expiration
- Or edit cache config to reduce max age

---

### Multi-Agent Verification 🔍

**When it triggers:**
- Complexity score >= 15
- Critical keywords: authentication, authorization, security, payment, migration
- User explicitly requests: `/prompt-hybrid [prompt] --verify`

**How it works:**
- Spawns 2-3 agents with different strategies in parallel
- Agents analyze independently
- System aggregates findings and identifies consensus
- Shows unanimous findings, majority findings, and disagreements

**Consensus levels:**
- High (>80%): Strong agreement, proceed with confidence
- Medium (66-80%): Reasonable agreement, minor differences
- Low (<66%): Significant disagreements, user input needed

**Benefits:**
- Cross-validation reduces errors
- Multiple perspectives on complex tasks
- Higher confidence in critical operations
- Identifies edge cases one agent might miss

**Example output:**
```
✅ Multi-Agent Verification Complete

Agreement Level: High (85%)

Unanimous Findings:
- Use existing AuthService pattern
- JWT tokens with 24h expiration
- Hash passwords with BCrypt

Disagreements:
⚠️ Agent 1: Suggests OAuth integration
⚠️ Agent 2: Suggests 2FA requirement

User choice: [Select approach or explain differences]
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be as specific as possible** - Even if agent fills gaps, your initial context helps
2. **Trust the complexity detection** - Let the system decide when to use agents
3. **Review agent findings** - Agent insights are shown transparently
4. **Ask for explanations** - Use `explain` to understand the analysis
5. **Iterate freely** - Use `modify` to refine without starting over

**Advanced Tips:** ⚡ **NEW**
6. **Leverage caching** - Similar prompts use cached results (10-20x faster)
7. **Review verification results** - Multi-agent verification shows consensus and disagreements
8. **Accept smart defaults** - Learning system improves with usage
9. **Clear cache when needed** - Delete `.claude/cache/agent-results/` if codebase changes significantly
10. **Track your patterns** - Review `.claude/memory/prompt-patterns.md` to see learning progress

## Troubleshooting

**Basic Issues:**

**Agent taking too long?**
- Explore agents timeout at 30s, Plan agents at 60s
- Multi-agent verification timeouts at 45s per agent
- If timeout, falls back to simple path with warning

**Complexity score seems wrong?**
- Edit `.claude/config/complexity-rules.json` to adjust weights
- Provide feedback via learning system
- System will suggest weight adjustments after detecting patterns

**Agent not finding relevant code?**
- Provide more specific keywords in your prompt
- Use `retry` with manual agent selection
- Check cache - might be using outdated results

---

**Advanced Features Issues:** ⚡ **NEW**

**Cache not working?**
- Check `.claude/config/cache-config.json` - ensure `"enabled": true`
- Verify `.claude/cache/agent-results/` directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Cache invalidates if files changed or 24h expired

**Cache giving outdated results?**
- Clear cache: Delete `.claude/cache/agent-results/`
- Or reduce `max_cache_age_hours` in cache-config.json
- Cache automatically invalidates on file changes
- Cache includes git branch - switching branches creates new cache

**Multi-agent verification not triggering?**
- Check `.claude/config/verification-config.json` - ensure `"enabled": true`
- Verify complexity score >= 15 or critical keywords present
- Manually trigger: `/prompt-hybrid [prompt] --verify`
- Check `verification_triggers` configuration

**Agents disagree significantly?**
- This is normal for complex tasks
- Review all perspectives shown in consensus analysis
- Choose the approach that best fits your context
- Disagreement indicates legitimate trade-offs exist

**Learning system not tracking patterns?**
- Check `.claude/config/learning-config.json` - ensure `"enabled": true`
- Verify `.claude/memory/prompt-patterns.md` exists
- Patterns need 3+ occurrences to trigger smart defaults
- Check `learning_threshold` setting

**Smart defaults not appearing?**
- Need 3+ occurrences of pattern (configurable)
- Check `.claude/memory/prompt-patterns.md` for tracked patterns
- Verify `auto_suggest_improvements: true` in learning-config.json
- Pattern matching is case-insensitive

**Cache or learning files growing too large?**
- Cache auto-cleans based on `max_cache_size_mb` (default 50MB)
- Manually clear: Delete `.claude/cache/agent-results/`
- Learning file grows slowly, safe to periodically archive old entries
- Adjust `max_cache_age_hours` to expire cache sooner

**Performance slower than expected?**
- First run is always slower (no cache)
- Verify cache is enabled and working
- Check if multi-agent verification is triggering unnecessarily
- Adjust verification thresholds in config
- Use simpler prompts for quick iterations

## Performance Notes

**Basic Performance:**
- **Simple path:** < 2 seconds (inline validation only)
- **Complex path:** 10-30 seconds (agent exploration time)
- **Agent model:**
  - Explore: Haiku (fast, cost-effective)
  - Plan: Sonnet (thorough, higher quality)
- **Context preservation:** Main conversation preserved; agents run independently

**Advanced Features Performance:** ⚡ **NEW**
- **Cache hit:** ~2 seconds (10-20x faster than fresh analysis)
- **Cache miss:** Same as complex path (10-30s)
- **Multi-agent verification:** 30-50 seconds (2-3 agents in parallel)
- **Learning system:** < 1 second (pattern recording)
- **Cache overhead:** Minimal (~100ms for cache check)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Cache reduces repeated analysis costs by 90%+
- Parallel agent execution (not sequential)
- Compressed cache storage
- Early cache validation (before agent spawn)

---

## Integration

**Works standalone or with:**
- `/prompt-technical` - For technical deep-dive after perfection
- `/prompt` - For quick, simple prompts without complexity detection
- Other prompt commands - Complementary to existing commands

**Recommendation:**
- Use `/prompt` for quick, simple prompts (< 2 seconds)
- Use `/prompt-hybrid` for complex tasks needing codebase analysis
- Use `/prompt-technical` after hybrid for implementation details
