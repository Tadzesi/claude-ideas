# Prompt Perfection Core Library

**Version:** 1.3
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20
**Purpose:** Canonical Phase 0 implementation for all prompt commands
**AI Fluency:** Aligned with Anthropic's 4Ds Framework (Delegation, Description, Discernment, Diligence)

**Import Syntax:** Reference this file using @.claude/library/prompt-perfection-core.md

---

## Overview

This library defines the **universal Phase 0 flow** for transforming any user input into a perfect, unambiguous prompt that Claude Code can execute without guessing.

All prompt commands should use this library as their foundation, with optional domain-specific adaptations.

---

## How to Use This Library

### In Your Slash Command

Add this reference at the beginning of your command file:

```markdown
## Phase 0: Prompt Perfection

**Import:** Use the canonical Phase 0 flow from `.claude/library/prompt-perfection-core.md`

**Adaptation:** [None | Technical | Article | Session | Custom]

**Domain-Specific Criteria:** [If applicable, list additional criteria]
```

When Claude reads your command, it will:
1. Load this library's Phase 0 definition
2. Apply any domain-specific adaptations you specify
3. Execute the perfected flow consistently

---

## The Canonical Phase 0 Flow

### Step 0.1: Initial Analysis

**Purpose:** Understand what the user wants

**Actions:**
1. **Detect language:** Slovak / English / Other
2. **Identify prompt type:**
   - Task (implementation work)
   - Question (information request)
   - Bug Fix (problem resolution)
   - Explanation (understanding codebase)
   - Code Review (quality assessment)
   - Refactoring (code improvement)
   - Content Creation (writing/documentation)
   - Session Management (context saving/loading)
   - Other (specify)
3. **Extract core intent:** What does the user ultimately want to achieve?

**Output Format:**
```markdown
**Phase 0: Prompt Perfection**

**Detected Language:** [language]
**Prompt Type:** [type]
**Core Intent:** [one sentence summary]

**Original Input:**
> [user's exact words]
```

---

### Step 0.11: Quick Delegation Check *(AI Fluency - NEW v1.4)*

**Purpose:** Verify this task is appropriate for AI before proceeding

**Based on Anthropic's AI Fluency Framework - Delegation Competency:**

**Quick Assessment (3 checks):**

1. **Task Appropriateness:**
   - Is this task suitable for AI assistance?
   - Does it require human-only judgment (ethics, policy, irreversible decisions)?

2. **AI Capability Match:**
   - Does this match AI strengths (code analysis, text generation, pattern detection)?
   - Or does it exceed AI limitations (recent events, complex math, personal decisions)?

3. **Responsibility Awareness:**
   - Does the user understand they remain responsible for the output?
   - Are there safety/security implications requiring human oversight?

**Decision Logic:**
```
IF task requires ONLY human judgment (ethics, policy, personal):
    → Flag: "This requires human decision. I can help analyze, but you must decide."
    → Proceed with advisory mode

IF task involves irreversible actions (delete, deploy, publish):
    → Flag: "⚠️ Irreversible action detected. Requires explicit confirmation."
    → Add extra confirmation step

IF task matches AI strengths AND user accepts responsibility:
    → Proceed to Step 0.12

IF uncertain about appropriateness:
    → Ask: "This task involves [X]. Should I proceed with AI assistance, or would you prefer to handle this yourself?"
```

**Output (only when flags triggered):**
```markdown
**⚠️ Delegation Check:**
- Task Type: [Type]
- AI Appropriate: [Yes / Partial / Advisory Only]
- Note: [Any flags or concerns]
- Proceed? [Waiting for confirmation if flagged]
```

**Note:** For most tasks, this check passes silently. Only surface when concerns exist.

---

### Step 0.12: Interaction Mode Detection *(AI Fluency - NEW v1.3)*

**Purpose:** Determine the optimal human-AI collaboration mode for this task

**Based on Anthropic's AI Fluency Framework, detect one of three modes:**

**Automation Mode:**
- AI performs specific tasks based on specific human instructions
- Human defines WHAT, AI executes
- Best for: Simple tasks, clear instructions, single-file changes
- Indicators: "Fix X", "Add Y to Z", "Change A to B"

**Augmentation Mode:**
- Human and AI collaborate as thinking partners
- Iterative back-and-forth where both contribute
- Best for: Complex analysis, design decisions, problem-solving
- Indicators: "Help me understand", "What's the best approach", "Let's figure out"

**Agency Mode:**
- Human configures AI to work independently
- AI establishes knowledge and behavior patterns
- Best for: Research tasks, codebase exploration, multi-agent work
- Indicators: "Research X", "Explore the codebase", "Find all instances"

**Detection Logic:**
```
IF prompt contains direct commands AND clear scope:
    → Automation Mode
ELSE IF prompt requests collaboration OR decision-making:
    → Augmentation Mode
ELSE IF prompt requests independent research OR exploration:
    → Agency Mode
DEFAULT:
    → Augmentation Mode (most flexible)
```

**Output Format:**
```markdown
**Interaction Mode:** [Automation / Augmentation / Agency]
**Rationale:** [Why this mode fits the task]
**Implications:**
- [How AI will approach the task in this mode]
```

**Mode-Specific Adjustments:**
- **Automation:** Skip optional questions, execute directly
- **Augmentation:** Engage in dialogue, offer options, iterate
- **Agency:** Spawn agents if needed, work independently, report back

---

### Step 0.15: Predictive Intelligence (OPTIONAL - NEW v4.0)

**Purpose:** Provide proactive guidance and anticipate user needs BEFORE asking for missing information

**When to use:** When predictive intelligence is enabled in configuration

**Import:** Use Predictive Intelligence from `.claude/library/intelligence/predictive-intelligence-core.md`

**Configuration:** Check `.claude/config/predictive-intelligence.json` → `enabled`

**Process:**

IF predictive_intelligence.enabled == true:
  1. **Journey Stage Detection** - Understand where user is (exploring/implementing/debugging)
  2. **Domain Risk Analysis** - Identify security/compliance risks specific to domain
  3. **Project Pattern Recognition** - Detect existing project conventions
  4. **Relationship Mapping** - Connect to previous work and related areas
  5. **Proactive Warning System** - Warn about problems BEFORE user makes mistakes
  6. **Next-Steps Prediction** - Forecast logical followup tasks

**Output:**
```markdown
## 🔮 PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS

[Comprehensive proactive guidance - see predictive-intelligence-core.md for full template]

**Journey Stage:** [Stage] - [Guidance]
**Domain Risks:** [Warnings and mitigations]
**Project Patterns:** [Detected conventions]
**Related Work:** [Connections to previous work]
**Proactive Warnings:** [Problems to avoid]
**Next Steps:** [Recommended followups]

---
```

**After Predictive Intelligence, continue with Step 0.2** (now enhanced with predictive context)

**Note:** This step is OPTIONAL and can be disabled in configuration. When disabled, proceed directly to Step 0.2.

---

### Step 0.2: Completeness Check

**Purpose:** Identify missing critical information

**Universal Criteria (9 Components):**

Check for presence of:

**Product Description (WHAT):**
- [ ] **Goal:** Clear desired outcome (What should happen?)
- [ ] **Context:** Environment, technology, background (Where/when/why?)
- [ ] **Scope:** Specific files, components, areas (What exactly to touch?)
- [ ] **Requirements:** Specific needs or features (What must be included?)
- [ ] **Constraints:** Limitations, rules, compatibility (What to avoid/respect?)
- [ ] **Expected Result:** Success criteria (How to verify it's done?)

**Process Description (HOW):** *(AI Fluency - NEW)*
- [ ] **Approach:** Step-by-step instructions or methodology (How should AI work?)

**Performance Description (AI BEHAVIOR):** *(AI Fluency - NEW)*
- [ ] **Interaction Style:** Concise/detailed, challenging/supportive, autonomous/collaborative
- [ ] **Communication Tone:** Technical/casual, formal/conversational

**Output Format:**
```markdown
**Completeness Check:**

✅ **Present:**
- Goal: [extracted from user input]
- Context: [extracted from user input]

❌ **Missing:**
- Scope: Need to know which files/components
- Expected Result: Need to know how to verify success

⚠️ **Optional (but recommended):**
- Constraints: [None specified]
```

**Decision Point:**
- If ALL required components present → **Go to Step 0.4 (Correction)**
- If ANY required components missing → **Go to Step 0.3 (Clarification)**

---

### Step 0.3: Clarification Questions

**Purpose:** Gather missing information without guessing

**Rules:**
1. **Never assume** - Always ask when uncertain
2. **Prioritize questions** - Critical first, then important, then optional
3. **Provide context** - Explain why you're asking
4. **Offer options** - When multiple valid approaches exist
5. **One round preferred** - Ask all questions together when possible

**Question Priority Levels:**

**🚨 Critical (MUST have):**
- Questions about missing Goal, Scope, or Expected Result
- Ambiguities that block execution entirely
- Safety concerns (security, data loss, breaking changes)

**⚠️ Important (SHOULD have):**
- Questions about Context that affects approach
- Missing Requirements that impact quality
- Technical feasibility concerns

**💡 Optional (NICE to have):**
- Constraints that could optimize solution
- Preferences that improve user experience
- Additional features that add value

**Output Format:**
```markdown
**Missing Information - Need Your Input:**

🚨 **Critical:**
1. [Question about essential missing component]
   - Why I'm asking: [explanation]
   - Example: [concrete example if helpful]

⚠️ **Important:**
2. [Question about helpful context]
   - Why I'm asking: [explanation]

💡 **Optional:**
3. [Question about optimizations]
   - Why I'm asking: [explanation]
   - You can skip this if not applicable
```

**Multiple Approaches Pattern:**

When multiple valid solutions exist:

```markdown
**Multiple Approaches Detected:**

I can solve this in different ways. Which approach fits your needs?

**Option 1: [Name]**
- **Description:** [What this does]
- **Pros:** [Advantages]
- **Cons:** [Disadvantages]
- **Best for:** [Use case]

**Option 2: [Name]**
- **Description:** [What this does]
- **Pros:** [Advantages]
- **Cons:** [Disadvantages]
- **Best for:** [Use case]

⭐ **Recommended:** Option [X]
**Reasoning:** [Why this is best based on context]

*Please select: 1, 2, or describe your preference*
```

**Wait for User Response:**
- Process all answers
- If new questions arise, ask them
- Repeat until all required information gathered

---

### Step 0.4: Correction & Structuring

**Purpose:** Fix errors and transform into clear, executable format

**Correction Rules:**
1. **Fix grammar and spelling** - Make it professional
2. **Preserve technical terms** - Keep code, variable names, paths EXACTLY
3. **Clarify ambiguity** - Make vague statements specific
4. **Remove redundancy** - Eliminate duplicate information
5. **Maintain intent** - Keep user's original goal and tone

**Structuring Rules:**
1. **Use active voice** - "Create a function" not "A function should be created"
2. **Be specific** - "Add validation to UserService.Login()" not "Add validation"
3. **Number requirements** - Makes them easy to reference
4. **Separate concerns** - Goal ≠ Requirements ≠ Constraints
5. **Make it actionable** - Every requirement should be testable

**Track Changes:**
Keep a list of what you changed for transparency:
```markdown
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed typo: "impliment" → "implement"
- Clarified scope: "the code" → "src/services/UserService.cs"
- Added specificity: "validation" → "email format and password strength validation"
- Removed redundancy: Combined duplicate requirement about error handling
```

---

### Step 0.5: Output Perfect Prompt

**Purpose:** Present the perfected, executable prompt

**Universal Output Format:**

```markdown
**✨ Perfected Prompt:**

**Goal:** [One clear sentence stating the desired outcome]

**Context:**
- Environment: [OS, platform, runtime]
- Technology Stack: [languages, frameworks, libraries]
- Project Background: [relevant context about the project]
- Current State: [what exists now, if relevant]

**Scope:**
- Files to modify: [list with paths]
- Files to create: [list with paths]
- Components affected: [list]
- Areas impacted: [list]

**Requirements:**
1. [First specific, testable requirement]
2. [Second specific, testable requirement]
3. [Third specific, testable requirement]
[...continue as needed]

**Constraints:**
- [Constraint 1: performance, security, compatibility]
- [Constraint 2: coding standards, patterns to follow]
- [Constraint 3: limitations to respect]
Or: *None specified*

**Expected Result:**
[Clear description of what success looks like]
- How to verify: [specific test/check]
- How to measure: [metrics if applicable]

**Discernment Hints:** *(AI Fluency - Optional)*
- **Product Evaluation:** [How to evaluate output quality - accuracy, appropriateness]
- **Process Evaluation:** [How to verify reasoning - check for logical errors]
- **Performance Evaluation:** [Communication style feedback - was it helpful?]

**Changes Made:**
- [List of corrections and improvements for transparency]
```

---

### Step 0.6: Approval Gate

**Purpose:** Get user confirmation before proceeding

**Always wait for user approval.** Never proceed automatically.

**Output Format:**
```markdown
---

⏸️ **Perfected Prompt Ready - Awaiting Your Approval**

**Summary:**
- Type: [prompt type]
- Goal: [brief goal summary]
- Scope: [scope summary]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low - based on completeness]

**What happens next:**
After you approve, I will [execute task / answer question / generate content / etc.]

**⚖️ Diligence Reminder (AI Fluency):**
You remain responsible for any output generated from this prompt.
- Verify key facts before deployment
- Review AI-generated code before committing
- Test thoroughly before production use

**Reply with:**
- `y` or `yes` — Execute this perfected prompt
- `n` or `no` — Cancel
- `modify [description]` — Adjust the prompt (tell me what to change)
- `explain [component]` — Explain why I included/changed something
- `options` — Show me alternative approaches (if applicable)
```

**Handle User Responses:**

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `yes` / `y` | Proceed to Phase 1 (command-specific execution) |
| `no` / `n` | Cancel and inform user: "Prompt perfection cancelled." |
| `modify [X]` | Apply changes, re-display perfected prompt, wait for approval |
| `explain [X]` | Provide detailed explanation, re-prompt for approval |
| `options` | Show alternative approaches if multiple exist, wait for selection |

---

## Step 0.7: Post-Execution Evaluation *(AI Fluency - NEW v1.4)*

**Purpose:** Close the feedback loop by evaluating output quality

**Based on Anthropic's AI Fluency Framework - Discernment Competency:**

After task execution completes, prompt for evaluation:

**Quick Evaluation Prompt:**
```markdown
---

**📊 Quick Evaluation (Discernment Check)**

How was this output?

- `good` — Accurate, appropriate, useful ✅
- `partial` — Mostly good, needs minor adjustments ⚠️
- `wrong` — Significant issues, needs rework ❌
- `explain` — Show me your reasoning 🔍

*Your feedback helps improve future interactions.*
```

**Handle Responses:**

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `good` | Record success, offer next steps |
| `partial` | Ask: "What needs adjustment?" → Apply changes |
| `wrong` | Ask: "What specifically was wrong?" → Record for learning, offer retry |
| `explain` | Show reasoning/process, re-prompt for evaluation |

**If `partial` or `wrong`:**
1. Identify what went wrong (Product/Process/Performance Discernment)
2. Record observation in `.claude/memory/observations.md`
3. Suggest: "Consider running `/reflect` to capture this learning"

**Discernment Types (AI Fluency):**
- **Product Discernment:** Is the output accurate, appropriate, coherent, relevant?
- **Process Discernment:** Was the reasoning sound? Any logical errors?
- **Performance Discernment:** Was the communication style effective?

**Note:** This step is optional for quick tasks. Always offer for complex tasks or when output quality is uncertain.

---

## The Feedback Loop *(AI Fluency Pattern)*

**The core AI Fluency workflow:**

```
    DESCRIBE          EVALUATE
   (what you want) → (what you got)
         ↑               ↓
         └─── REFINE ←──┘
           (improve prompt)
```

**Effective AI use is iterative.** Don't expect perfection on the first try. The skill is in the conversation, not the single prompt.

**After any output, consider:**
1. **Evaluate:** Does this meet the goal?
2. **If not:** Identify what's wrong (accuracy? relevance? style?)
3. **Refine:** Adjust your request with specific feedback
4. **Repeat:** Until satisfied

**Useful follow-up phrases:**
- "Make it more [concise/detailed/formal/casual]"
- "Focus more on [specific aspect]"
- "Remove the section about [topic]"
- "Add examples for [concept]"
- "Explain this for [audience type]"
- "This is wrong because [reason], please fix"

**Common Iteration Patterns:**
- Too long → "Make it more concise, focus on [key points]"
- Too vague → "Be more specific about [aspect]"
- Wrong tone → "Use a more [formal/casual/technical] tone"
- Missing context → "Also consider [additional context]"
- Incorrect facts → "Check [specific claim], I believe it should be [correction]"
