# Command Predictive Intelligence Analysis

**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Purpose:** Determine which commands should integrate predictive intelligence

---

## Decision Matrix

| Command | Include PI? | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `/prompt` | ✅ YES | Basic prompt perfection - would benefit from proactive guidance |
| `/prompt-hybrid` | ✅ YES | Already complex, perfect fit for predictive intelligence |
| `/prompt-technical` | ✅ YES | Technical analysis needs proactive risk warnings |
| `/prompt-research` | ✅ YES | Research could benefit from predictive scoping |
| `/prompt-article` | ❌ NO | Content creation domain, different use case |
| `/prompt-article-readme` | ❌ NO | README generation, different domain |
| `/session-end` | ❌ NO | Memory capture, not prompt perfection |
| `/session-start` | ❌ NO | Memory loading, not prompt perfection |
| `/example-custom-command` | ❌ NO | Template/example file |

## Integration Strategy

### HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Integration):

**1. /prompt-hybrid** - PRIMARY TARGET
- Already has complexity detection
- Users expect advanced features
- Most benefit from predictive intelligence
- Integration: FULL (all 6 steps)

**2. /prompt-technical** - SECONDARY TARGET
- Technical users need risk warnings
- Security/performance critical
- Integration: FULL (all 6 steps)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Phase 2):

**3. /prompt** - BASIC INTEGRATION
- Keep it simple
- Optional predictive intelligence
- Integration: LITE (warnings + next steps only)

**4. /prompt-research** - OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT
- Already comprehensive
- Add predictive scoping before research
- Integration: CUSTOM (journey + scope prediction)

---

## Integration Levels

### FULL Integration:
- All 6 predictive intelligence steps
- Journey stage detection
- Domain risk analysis
- Project pattern recognition
- Relationship mapping
- Proactive warnings
- Next-steps prediction

### LITE Integration:
- Warnings only (security, breaking changes)
- Next-steps prediction
- Skip pattern recognition and relationship mapping

### CUSTOM Integration:
- Select specific steps based on command needs
- Tailored to command's purpose

## Implementation Order

1. ✅ Create predictive intelligence library (DONE)
2. ⏳ Update `/prompt-hybrid` (FULL integration)
3. ⏳ Update `/prompt-technical` (FULL integration)
4. ⏳ Update `/prompt` (LITE integration)
5. ⏳ Update `/prompt-research` (CUSTOM integration)
