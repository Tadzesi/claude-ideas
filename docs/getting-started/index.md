# Getting Started

Welcome to the Claude Commands Library! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is Claude Commands Library?

The Claude Commands Library is a collection of reusable slash commands for Claude Code that enhance prompt engineering, content creation, and session management.

### Key Features

- **Prompt Perfection** - Transform vague ideas into precise, executable prompts
- **Intelligent Agents** - Automatic codebase analysis when needed
- **Advanced Features** - Caching, multi-agent verification, and learning
- **Session Management** - Zero information loss between sessions
- **Content Creation** - Generate articles and documentation
- **Technical Analysis** - Implementation planning with code scaffolding

## Architecture

The library uses a **unified library system** where:

1. **Core Library** - Canonical Phase 0 implementation
2. **Adapters** - Domain-specific customizations
3. **Commands** - Slash commands that reference the library
4. **Configuration** - JSON configs for complexity detection, agents, caching

### Benefits

- ✅ Consistency across all commands
- ✅ Single source of truth for Phase 0
- ✅ Easy maintenance (update once, all benefit)
- ✅ Smaller command files

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installed and configured
