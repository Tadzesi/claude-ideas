# Session management
/session-start    # Load previous context
/session-end      # Save current work
```

## Why Claude Commands Library?

### 🎯 Zero-Guessing Execution

Every prompt is analyzed, clarified, and perfected before execution. No more ambiguous requests that lead to wrong implementations.

### 🚀 Smart Complexity Detection

Automatically detects when tasks need deep codebase analysis and spawns intelligent agents only when necessary.

### ⚡ Performance Optimized

Agent result caching provides 10-20x speed improvement for repeated or similar prompts.

### 📚 Continuous Learning

The system learns from your patterns and suggests smart defaults, improving over time.

## What's New in v4.0 🔮

Version 4.0 introduces **Predictive Intelligence** - see 2 steps ahead with proactive guidance:

- 🔮 **NEW: Phase 0.15 Predictive Intelligence** - Journey stage detection, proactive warnings, next-steps prediction
- ⚠️ **Domain Risk Analysis** - 20+ risks across 6 domains (auth, payment, database, API, security, performance)
- 📐 **Pattern Recognition** - Auto-detect naming conventions and architectural patterns
- 🔗 **Relationship Mapping** - Connect current work to previous tasks
- ⏭️ **Next-Steps Prediction** - Forecast logical followups with P0-P3 priorities
- 🎯 **Smart Scoping** - Choose Focused/Balanced/Comprehensive analysis depth

**Before v4.0:** Reactive - fix problems after they occur
**After v4.0:** Proactive - prevent problems before coding starts
