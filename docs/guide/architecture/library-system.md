# Unified Library System

The library-based architecture ensures consistency and maintainability.

## Overview

Commands reference a core library instead of duplicating Phase 0 logic.

### Components

1. **Core Library** - `.claude/library/prompt-perfection-core.md`
2. **Adapters** - Domain-specific customizations
3. **Commands** - Reference the library
4. **Configuration** - JSON configs

### Benefits

- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Easy maintenance
- ✅ Consistent experience
- ✅ Smaller command files
